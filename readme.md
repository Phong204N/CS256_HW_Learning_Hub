## Usage

When first accessing the site, the user will be greeted by a login screen.  If an account already exists, then the user may continue to log in.  If not, then a registration option is available.  Once registered and logged in, the home page will be made available.  This is the main dashboard and holds quick links and cards curated for the user.  The customized search engine will be available here as well, near the bottom.  

By utilizing the nav bar at the top of each page, the other options aforementioned are made available.  To submit a resource for review, the user can use the "Submit" link under their profile drop down.  Approved resources and other bookmarks are stored under "My Resources" and "Bookmarks".  For Admins, the ability to review and approve/deny resources is linked near the same section.  On this page, all resources that have been submitted and not yet reviewed are displayed with a positive and negative button.
